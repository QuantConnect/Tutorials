  We apply this technique to model stock prices in order to look at the potential evolution of stock prices over time and then demonstrate how to price the European options. Here we use Google as an example. Suppose today is 07/31/2017, the share price of GOOG is $930.5. We use the historical close price from 01/2015 to 07/2017 to compute the historical annual return and volatility as the mu and sigma parameters. (Note, we do not need to concern with the detailed determinants of 􏰯\(\mu\) because the value of options written on a stock is, in general, independent of􏰯 \(\mu\). In contrast, the stock price volatility \(\sigma\) is of crucial importance to the determination of the value of options). Consider GOOG that pays no-dividends, has an expected return 39.64% per annum with continuous compounding and a volatility of 23.44% per annum. Observe today’s price $903.5 per share and with ∆t = 0.001 yr. Then we apply Monte Carlo to simulate 500 price paths in the next three months.
