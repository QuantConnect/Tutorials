<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
  In this chapter, we will discuss the option's payoff if you long or short the options. Then we discuss the put-call parity which is a relationship between the price of a European call option, the price of a European put option, and the underlying stock price. In addition, an application of put-call parity in arbitrage trading strategies was demonstrated.
