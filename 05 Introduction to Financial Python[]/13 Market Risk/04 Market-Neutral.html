  A portfolio is market-neutral if its <strong>&beta; is zero</strong>. In other words, the portfolio's returns are uncorrelated with market returns. We say that it has no "market risk". Some classical market-neutral strategies are pairs trading, beta-hedged equity portfolio and other derivatives strategies.
  We have daily returns of Dow 30 stocks from March 2012 to Jan 2015. For each stock, its &beta; on any given day is computed using the past 6 months' returns. As this 6-month window moves forward in time, &beta; will of course change.
  Once we know how each stock's &beta; has changed over time, we can ask: which stocks' betas are correlated with each other? The table below shows the correlation between each stock's beta.

  How can we construct a market-neutral portfolio? Consider two stocks A and B:
</p>
\[ R_A = R_0 + \beta_A (R_{\text{market}} - R_0) \]
\[ R_B = R_0 + \beta_B (R_{\text{market}} - R_0) \]

<p>
  Let's allocate <em>w</em> on stock A and (1 &minus; <em>w</em>) on stock B, then market neutrality means
</p>
\[ w\beta_A + (1-w) \beta_B = 0 \qquad \Rightarrow \qquad
   w = \frac{\beta_B}{\beta_B - \beta_A} \]

<p>
  As mentioned earlier, \(\beta_A\) and \(\beta_B\) will change with time, so will \(w\) in a market-neutral portfolio. However we can achieve market neutrality with constant \(w\) so long as \(\beta_A\) and \(\beta_B\) have a linear relationship:
</p>
\[ \beta_A = m\beta_B + c \]

<p>
  Then eliminate \(\beta_A\) to get
</p>
\[ w = \frac{\beta_B}{(1-m) \beta_B - c} \]

<p>
  If <em>c</em> &approx; 0 then <em>w</em> is roughly constant:
</p>
\[ w = \frac{1}{1-m} \]

<p>
  Note: If <em>c</em> is signficant, then we need 3 stocks to get zero net beta. Usually 2 stocks are sufficient to cancel out most of the market risk.
</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>
  The 6-month rolling betas of PG and KO stocks have a correlation of 93%. The linear relationship between their betas is
</p>
\[ \beta_{KO} = -0.0097 + 0.969 \beta_{PG} \]

<p>
  Therefore the market neutral weights are
</p>
\[ w_{KO} = \frac{1}{1-0.969} = 32.3 \qquad w_{PG} = 1 - w_{KO} = -31.3 \]

<p>
  We tested this portfolio both in-sample (March 2012 to Jan 2015) and out-of-sample. It achieved a beta of 0.01 and -0.004 respectively. See the backtest below.
