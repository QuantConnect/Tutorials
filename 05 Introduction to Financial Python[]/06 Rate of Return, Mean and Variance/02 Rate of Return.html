<h4>Single-period Return</h4>
<p>
  The single-period rate of return can be calculated as following:
</p>
\[r = \frac{p_t}{p_0} - 1 = \frac{p_t - p_0}{p_0}\]
<p>
  Where \(r\) is the rate of return, \(p_t\) is the asset price at time \(t\), and \(p_0\) is the asset price at time 0.
</p>

<div class="section-example-container">

<pre class="python">
import numpy as np
rate_return = 102.0/100 - 1
print rate_return
[out]: 0.02
</pre>
</div>
<p>
  Let's say we bought a stock at $100, and half a year later it will grow to $102. A year later the price will come to $104. How to calculate our total return? Well, we can either deem it as a single-period:
</p>
\[r = 104/100 - 1 = 0.04\]
<p>
  or as a two-stage period:
</p>
\[ r = (1+r_1)*(1+r_2) - 1 = \frac{102}{100} * \frac{104}{102} -1 = 0.04\]
<p>
  Here we make calculations twice a year. It's called semi-annual compounding. How about quarterly compounding? Let's assume the stock prices at the end of each quarter are \(p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4\) respectively.
</p>
\[r = (1+r_1)*(1+r_2)*(1+r_3)*(1+r_4) -1\]
<p>
  The rate of return we calculate here is called <strong>cumulative return</strong> or<strong> overall return</strong>. It measures the total return of this asset over a period of time.
</p>
<p>
  Now consider the following situation: we have two strategies: strategy A and strategy B. We backtested strategy A for 1 years and the cumulative return is 20%, while we backtested strategy B for 3 months and the cumulative return is 65%. Which strategy has a high rate of return? Our commonly used method is to convert all the returns into <strong>compounding annual return</strong>, regardless of the investing horizon of each strategy. We can compare the returns of strategies with different time horizon now. Since there are four quarters in a year,the annual return of strategy B is
</p>
\[(1+r)^4 = 1+0.65\]
\[ r = \sqrt[4]{1.65} - 1\ = 0.133368\]
<p>
  Strategy A has an higher compounding annual return when we compare 0.133 and 0.2.
</p>
<h4>Logarithm Return</h4>
<p>
  We introduced compounding annual return above, which is a kind of <strong>effective rate of return</strong>. You can regard it as a 'hypothetical return'. Strategy B might never have a 18.167% rate of rate annually during the 3-year backtesting period. However, if we assume that the strategy has a 18.167% rate of return every year, it has the same cumulative return over the 3 years. As we mentioned previously, if we assume a strategy is quarterly compounding, the relation between quarterly effective rate of return and annual return is:
</p>
\[(1+\frac{r}{4})^4 = 1+r\]
<p>
  More generally, if the times of compounding in one year is \(n\) and the annual rate of return is \(r\), the relation is given by:
</p>
\[(1+\frac{r}{n})^n = 1+r\]
<p>
  Now imagine the stock markets. The prices of your assets is changing every second, or even every millisecond. If the times of compounding, or n, approach to infinite, this is called <strong>continuous compounding</strong>. The calculation formula is given below:
</p>
\[\lim_{n \to \infty }(1+\frac{r}{n})^n = e^r\]
<p>
  From the above limitation equation, we know that if we assume continuous compounding:
</p>
\[e^r = 1 + r = \frac{p_t}{p_0}\]
<p>
  Then we take \(ln\) on both side of the equation:
</p>
\[r = ln\frac{p_t}{p_0} = lnp_t - lnp_0\]
<p>
  Here we got the<strong> logarithmic return, </strong>or <strong>continuously compounded return</strong>. This is frequently used when calculating returns, because once we take logarithm of asset prices, we can calculate the logarithm return by simply doing a subtraction. Here we use Apple stock prices as a example:

  Here we calculated the daily logarithmic return of Apple stock. Given that we know the daily logarithm return of in this month, we can calculate the monthly return by simply sum all the daily returns up.
</p>

<div class="section-example-container">

<pre class="python">month_return = aapl.log_return.sum()
print month_return
[out]: 0.0273081001636
</pre>
</div>
<p>
  It may sounds incorrect to sum up the daily returns, but we can prove that it's mathematically correct. Let's assume the stock prices in a period of time are represented by \([p_0, p_1, p_2, p_3.....p_n]\). Then the cumulative rate of return is given by:
</p>
\[1+r = ln\frac{p_t}{p_0} = ln\frac{p_t}{p_{t-1}} + ln\frac{p_{t-1}}{p_{t-2}}+......+ln\frac{p_1}{p_0}\]
<p>
  According to the equation above, we can simple sum up each logarithmic return in a period to get the cumulative return. The convenience of this method is also one of the reasons why we use logarithmic return in quantitative finance.
