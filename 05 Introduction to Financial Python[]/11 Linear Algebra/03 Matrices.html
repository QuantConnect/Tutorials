  If we have a few vectors \( \mathbf{v}_1, \mathbf{v}_2, \dots, \mathbf{v}_n \) with the same dimension, then we can put them side-by-side to form a <strong>matrix</strong>. For example, the vectors
</p>
\[ v_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} \qquad
   v_2 = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 2 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} \qquad
   v_3 = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \]

<p>
  can be combined to produce a matrix:
</p>
\[ m = \begin{pmatrix}
1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 \\
2 &amp; 2 &amp; 2 \\
3 &amp; 1 &amp; 1
\end{pmatrix} \]

<p>
  m is a 3 &times; 3 matrix. We typically describe the dimensions of a matrix as \(m \times n\) where m = number of rows and n = number of columns.
</p>

<p>
  A <strong>square</strong> matrix is one with as many rows as columns.
</p>

<p>
  Notation: \(x_{ij}\) refers to a specific value in row \(i\) and column \(j\) of a matrix \(X\). For example, \(x_{23}\) is the number in the second row and third column of \(X\).

<h3>Python Implementation</h3>

<p>
  In Python, the NumPy package deals with linear algebra. The array we learned in the NumPy chapter can be deemed as a vector:
</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
<pre class="csharp">
</pre>
<pre class="python">import numpy as np
a = np.array([1,2,3])
b = np.array([2,2,2])
c = np.array([3,1,1])
matrix = np.column_stack((a,b,c))
print matrix
print type(matrix)
[out]:
[[1 2 3]
 [2 2 1]
 [3 2 1]]
</pre>
</div>

<p>
  It is worth noticing that we used column_stack() here to ensure that the vectors are vertical and placed side-by-side to form a matrix. Without the column_stack() function, the vectors will be made horizontal and stacked on top of one another:
</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
<pre class="csharp">
</pre>
<pre class="python">matrix2 = np.array([a,b,c])
print matrix2
[out]:
[[1 2 3]
 [2 2 2]
 [3 1 1]]
</pre>
</div>
