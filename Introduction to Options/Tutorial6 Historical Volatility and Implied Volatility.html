<h2>Introduction</h2>
The change of volatility can have a significant impact on any options trading strategies performance. In addition to the Vega we explained in Greeks letter chapter, this part of the volatility tutorial will discuss the concept of volatility, specifically, we discuss realized and implied volatility, their meanings, measurements, uses, and limitations.

<h2>Historical Volatility</h2>

<div class="column">
<h3>1. Definition</h3>
It is a measurement of how much the price of the asset has changed on average during the certain period of time. In common, volatility is said to be the standard deviation of the return of assets price.
<h3>2. Calculation</h3>
Here we discuss how to estimate the historical volatility of the option written on specific underlying asset empirically.

\[r_i=ln(\frac{S_i}{S_{i-1}})\quad for\ i=0,1,2,3,...,n\]

Where (n+1) is the number of observations, \(S_i\) is the stock price at end of it time interval

The  standard deviation of the \(r_i\) is given by
\[std=\sqrt{\frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^n(r_i-\overline{r})^2}\]
where \(\overline{r}\) is the mean of \(r_i\)

If we assume there are n trading days per year. Then the estimate of historical volatility per annum is

\[std\times\sqrt{n}\]

std = sqrt(sum(diff_square)*(1.0/(len(r)-1)))
vol = std*sqrt(252)</pre>
An asset has a historical volatility based on its past performance as described above, investors can gain insight on the fluctuations of the underlying price during the past period of time. But it does not tell us anything about the volatility in the market now and in the future. So here we introduce the implied volatility.
<h2><strong>Implied Volatility</strong></h2>
In contrast to historical volatility, the implied volatility looks ahead. It is often interpreted as the market’s expectation for the future volatility of a stock and is implied by the price of the stock’s options. Here implied volatility means it is not observable in the market but can be derived from the price of an option.
<h3>1. Definition</h3>
<div class="page" title="Page 73">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">

We use volatility as an input parameter in option pricing model. If we take a look at the BSM pricing, the theoretical price or the fair value of an option is P, where P is a function of historical volatility σ, stock  price S, strike price K, risk-free rate r and the time to expiration T.  That is \(P=f(\sigma,S,K,r,T)\). But the market price of options is not always the same with the theoretical price. Now in contrast, if we are given the market’s prices of calls and puts written on some asset and also the value of S, K, r, T. For each asset we can solve a new volatility that corresponds to the price of each option – the implied volatility. Then the implied volatility is \(\IV=f^{-1}(P,S,K,r,T)\).
<h3>2. Calculation</h3>
Here we use the bisection method to solve the BSM pricing equation and find the root which is the implied volatility. We use Yahoo Finance Python API to get the real time option data.
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">import numpy as np
import scipy.stats as sp

def bsm_price(option_type, sigma, s, k, r, T, q):
    # calculate the bsm price of European call and put option
    d1 = (np.log(s / k) + (r - q + sigma ** 2 * 0.5) * T) / (sigma * np.sqrt(T))
    d2 = d1 - sigma * np.sqrt(T)
    if option_type == 'c':
        price = np.exp(-r*T) * (s * np.exp((r - q)*T) * sp.norm.cdf(d1) - k *  sp.norm.cdf(d2))
        return price
    elif option_type == 'p':
        price = np.exp(-r*T) * (k * sp.norm.cdf(-d2) - s * np.exp((r - q)*T) *  sp.norm.cdf(-d1))
        return price
    else:
        print('No such option type %s') %option_type
def implied_vol(option_type, option_price, s, k, r, T, q):
    # apply bisection method to get the implied volatility by solving the BSM function
    precision = 0.0001
    upper_vol = 10000
    max_vol = 10000
    lower_vol = 0.0001
    iteration = 0
    while 1:
        iteration = +1
        mid_vol = (upper_vol + lower_vol)/2.0
        price = bsm_price(option_type, mid_vol, s, k, r, T, q)
        lower_price = bsm_price(option_type, lower_vol, s, k, r, T, q)
        if (lower_price - option_price) * (price - option_price) &gt; 0:
            lower_vol = mid_vol
        else:
            upper_vol = mid_vol
        if abs(price - option_price) &lt; precision: break if mid_vol &gt; max_vol - 5 :
            mid_vol = 0
            break
    return mid_vol
implied_vol('c', 0.3, 3, 3, 0.032, 30.0/365, 0.01)
</pre>
From the result above, the implied volatility of European call option (with premium c=0.3, S=3, K=3, r=0.032, T =30 days, d=0.01) is 0.87.
<h3>3. Factors affecting Implied Volatility</h3>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Time Value of the option</strong></li>
</ul>
According to the time value description in the first tutorial, [ref]Options Pricing: Intrinsic Value And Time Value, Jean Folger, <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/university/options-pricing/intrinsic-value-time-value.asp?lgl=rira-baseline-vertical">Online Copy</a>[/ref]in general, the more time to expiration, the greater the time value of the option. Investors are willing to pay extra money for zero intrinsic value options which have more time to expiration because more time increases the likelihood of price movement and fluctuations, it is the options will become profitable. Implied volatility tends to be an increasing function of maturity. A short-dated option often has a low implied volatility, whereas a long-dated option tends to have a high implied volatility.

<h2>Volatility Skew</h2>
For European options of the same maturity and the same underlying assets, the implied volatilities vary with the strikes. For a series of put options or call options, if we plot these implied volatilities for a series of options which have the same expiration date and the same underlying with the x axis being the different strikes, we would get a convex curve. The shape of this curve is like people's smiling, it is being called the volatility.

If we Keep the same expiry date and the same underlying assets, the implied volatility can be measured for different strike prices. This curve is called the volatility smile. The shape of volatility smile depends on the assets and the market conditions.

Here we give an example how to plot the volatility smile by using the real time options data of SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF(NYSEARCA: SPY).

80% OTM put has a different implied volatility to the ATM put. Plotting these implied volatilities across strikes gives us the implied volatility skew, also referred to as volatility skew, or even just skew. Although the volatility skew is dynamic, in equity markets it is almost always a decreasing function of the strike. Other asset classes such as FX and commodities have differently shaped skews.

<h3>Reason for volatility skew</h3>
There are several reasons for the existence of this implied volatility skew. Implied volatility is the market’s consensus on the volatility of the asset between now and the maturity of the option. Put options pay on the downside and are thus good hedging instruments against market crashes. If an asset drops in price, this is generally accompanied by an increase in its volatility. In this case, fear manifests itself because of the increased uncertainty and risk involved in such a drop. This is reflected in the implied volatilities of the OTM puts being higher than the OTM calls because puts pay on the downside.

The realized volatility of an asset, as just seen, is a measure of how the asset’s price fluctuated over a specific period of time. It is also called historical volatility because it reflects the past; however, it does not necessarily contain information about the current market sentiment. The implied volatility of an asset on the other hand, as the name suggests, is a representative of what the market is implying in terms of volatility.

Using the correct implied volatility of an asset allows one to price other derivatives on the asset, in particular, those that are not liquidly traded. Where the implied volatility of an asset cannot be implied from traded instruments, one may resort to using the realized volatility as a proxy for implied volatility to get an idea of what volatility would be correct to use.

<h2>Summary</h2>
The historical volatility of an asset is the statistical measure we know as the standard deviation of the stock return series. The implied volatility of the same asset, on the other hand, is the volatility parameter that we can infer from the prices of traded options written on this asset. In contrast to historical volatility, which looks at fluctuations of asset prices in the past, implied volatility looks ahead. The two volatilities do not necessarily coincide, and although they may be close, they are typically not equal.
