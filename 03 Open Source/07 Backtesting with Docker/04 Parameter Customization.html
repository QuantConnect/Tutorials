Lean runs on configurations that change and hone the algorithm that you're testing. In the example above, we backtest with a test configuration that ship's with Lean's source---
which is helpful for getting things set up, but isn't the end goal. The end goal, of course, is to backtest a different/custom algorithm.
</p>
<p>
To do this, first we need to open a text editor and take a look at the file <mark>~/Lean/Launcher/.config.json</mark>. By default, it looks like this:
<div class="section-example-container">
<pre>
    {
        // this configuration file works by first loading all top-level
        // configuration items and then will load the specified environment
        // on top, this provides a layering affect. environment names can be
        // anything, and just require definition in this file. There's
        // two predefined environments, 'backtesting' and 'live', feel free
        // to add more!

        "environment": "backtesting", // "live-paper", "backtesting", "live-interactive", "live-interactive-iqfeed"

        // algorithm class selector
        "algorithm-type-name": "BasicTemplateFrameworkAlgorithm",

        // Algorithm language selector - options CSharp, Python
        "algorithm-language": "CSharp",

        //Physical DLL location
        "algorithm-location": "QuantConnect.Algorithm.CSharp.dll",
        //"algorithm-location": "../../../Algorithm.Python/BasicTemplateFrameworkAlgorithm.py",

        //Research notebook
        //"composer-dll-directory": ".",

        // engine
        "data-folder": "../../../Data/",

        ...
</pre>
</div>
The part we're most interested in is this:
<div class="section-example-container">
<pre>
    // algorithm class selector
    "algorithm-type-name": "BasicTemplateFrameworkAlgorithm",

    // Algorithm language selector - options CSharp, Python
    "algorithm-language": "CSharp",

    //Physical DLL location
    "algorithm-location": "QuantConnect.Algorithm.CSharp.dll",
    //"algorithm-location": "../../../Algorithm.Python/BasicTemplateFrameworkAlgorithm.py",
</pre>
</div>
</p>
<p>
This tells Lean to run a strategy called <mark>DualThrustIntradayAlgorithm</mark> (an example I took from
<a href="https://www.quantconnect.com/tutorials/strategy-library/dual-thrust-trading-algorithm">QuantConnect's documentation on various strategies</a>)
that is written in Python, and located at a generic path (<mark>/path/of/the/algorithm/goes/here</mark>) that you'll need to replace with the path 
of your desired strategy. This, of course, can be replaced with whatever strategy you please---just
be sure to change the name, set the appropriate language, and set the correct path, like we did in the example above.
</p>
<p>
A note for those unfamiliar with JSON: the // symbols represent comments, and ensures that the lines they are on aren't interpreted. Since we aren't using C#
for this strategy, we can either comment the .dll line out (like I did in the example), or you can delete it altogether, it doesn't make any difference.
</p>
<p>
Now, save your changes, exit your text editor, and bring a terminal back up. To run the tests again with our new changes, navigate back to <mark>~/Lean</mark> and run:
<div class="section-example-container">
<pre>
    # on linux/mac:
    sudo ./run_docker.sh

    # on windows:
    C:\path\to\the\lean\directory\run_docker.bat
</pre>
</div>
and it should run through the process again with your changes!
