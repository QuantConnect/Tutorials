In this tutorial, we have learned how to utilize Docker to efficiently backtest strategies with LEAN. Docker removes the setup overhead (dependencies, install, etc) that installing LEAN on 
the host system would have, and allows us to easily test multiple strategies in an isolated environment (in this case, a Docker container) with comparatively easy cleanup.
