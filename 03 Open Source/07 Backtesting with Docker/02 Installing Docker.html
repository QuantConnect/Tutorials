According to their website, Docker <a href="https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/">"is an open platform fdr developing, shipping, and running applications."</a>
We can use Docker to isolate the backtesting process with Lean, and get started with less overhead than a local install.
</p>

Docker's website lists the following system requirements:
<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
    <li>a 64 bit processor with Second Level Address Translation (SLAT)</li>
    <li>4GB of RAM</li>
    <li>BIOS-level hardware <a href="https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/troubleshoot/#virtualization-must-be-enabled">virtualization</a> support enabled</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Additionally, Docker support for operating systems other than:
<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
    <li>Linux</li>
    <li>macOS</li>
    <li>Windows</li>
</ul>
seems limited <i>at bset</i> as of the time of writing, so when using a different operating system,
your mileage following this tutorial may vary.
</p>
<p>
To install Docker, you can follow the instructions over at <a href="https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/">Docker's website</a>. To ensure that the installation went smoothly, you can run:
<div class="section-example-container">
<pre>
    docker ps       # lists running containers (or the lack thereof)
    # or
    docker info     # displays some system information
</pre>
</div>
If either of these runs with no errors, Docker is installed and you're good to keep working through the tutorial!
