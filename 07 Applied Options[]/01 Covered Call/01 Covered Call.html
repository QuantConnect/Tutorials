<h2>Definition</h2>
<p>
  A Covered Call is an options strategy that involves both underlying stock and an options contract. The trader buys (or already owns) a stock, then sells call options for the same amount of stock. The aim of the Covered Call is to gain profits from option premium by selling calls written on the stock you already owned. At any time for US options or at expiration for European options, if the stock moves below the strike price, you can keep the premium and still maintain the stock position. If the price moves above the strike, the options contract is exercised you will sell the stock at the strike price but still keep the premium. The risk of a Covered Call also comes from the long stock position, which could drop.

The payoff  is as follows:

<h2>Implementation</h2>
<h3>Step 1: Initialize the Algorithm</h3>
<p>
At the beginning of your algorithm, you need to set the start date, the end date and the cash required for the algorithm. For options algorithm, you need to add the equity and the options written on this equity.
</p>
<div class="section-example-container">
<code class="csharp">
</code>
<code class="python">def Initialize(self):
   self.SetStartDate(2016, 1, 1)
   self.SetEndDate(2016, 3, 1)
   self.SetCash(100000)
   equity = self.AddEquity("IBM", Resolution.Minute)
   option = self.AddOption("IBM", Resolution.Minute)
   self.symbol = option.Symbol
   # set our strike/expiry filter for this option chain
   option.SetFilter(-3, +3, timedelta(0), timedelta(30))
   # use the underlying equity as the benchmark
   self.SetBenchmark(equity.Symbol)
   self.call = "IBM" # Initialize the call contract
</code>
</div>
<p>
Second, in the initialization process, you need to add a coarse selection for the options contracts. Here we use <code>option.SetFilter(-3, +3, timedelta(0), timedelta(60))</code> to implement the coarse selection process. If today's market price of underlying stock is $159, the strike prices of IBM options are spaced $5. Then SetFilter will look up the most at the money contract with the strike being K=$160 (Here K might not be $159 since rarely will option be ATM exactly). The filter will look for options with strikes between and including (160-5*3, 160+5*3). The time to expiration of these options is restricted within 60 days from now on.
</p>
<h3>Step 2: Choose the Call Options Contract</h3>
<p>
  First, purchase the underlying stock for 100 shares or an integral multiple of 100 shares. For options contract, one contract represents 100 shares of stock.
</p>
<p>
Second, filter out the call options from candidate contracts.<code>call = [x for x in chain if x.Right == 0]</code> For call options, the right is 0, for put options, the right is 1.
</p>
<p>
Third, select the most ATM contract with the furthest expiration date from call options contracts. Sell this call contract for each 100 shares of stock you own. Here you can also choose ITM or OTM contract based on your expected level of profit and the level of risk you can take.
</p>
<div class="section-example-container">
<code class="csharp">
</code>
<code class="python">def TradeOptions(self,slice):
		if slice.OptionChains.Count == 0: return
    for i in slice.OptionChains:
        if i.Key != self.symbol: continue
        chain = i.Value
        call = [x for x in chain if x.Right == 0] # filter the call options contracts
        # sorted the contracts according to their expiration dates and choose the ATM options
        contracts = sorted(sorted(call, key = lambda x: abs(chain.Underlying.Price - x.Strike)),
                                        key = lambda x: x.Expiry, reverse=True)
        if len(contracts) == 0: return
        contract = contracts[0]
        self.call = contract.Symbol
        self.Sell(self.call, 1) # short the call options
        if self.Portfolio["IBM"].Quantity == 0:
            self.Buy("IBM",100)     # buy 100 the underlying stock
            self.Log("The stock price at time 0 S(0): {}".format(self.Securities["IBM"].Price))
</code>
</div>
<p>
Fourth, at the expiration date we print out the price and position information
</p>
<div class="section-example-container">
<code class="csharp">
</code>
<code class="python">def OnData(self,slice):
    if not self.Portfolio[self.call].Invested and self.Time.hour != 0 and self.Time.minute == 1:
        self.TradeOptions(slice) # sell the call option

    # if the option contract expires, print out the price and position information
    if slice.Delistings.Count > 0:
        if [x.Key == self.call for x in slice.Delistings]:
            self.Log("stock IBM quantity: {0}".format(self.Portfolio["IBM"].Quantity))
            self.Log("{0} quantity: {1}".format(self.call.Value, self.Portfolio[self.call].Quantity))
            self.Log("The stock price at Expiry S(T): {}".format(self.Securities["IBM"].Price))
</code>
</div>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
  From the above strategy we can see,  the share price of IBM had been increasing during the backtesting period from January 2016 to June 2016. The drawdown is small. The Covered Call strategy performs better than a simple buy-and-hold strategy of underlying stock in a bearish market. The benefit of Covered Call is that you keep the premium, stock gains up to the strike price, and accrued dividends during the stock holding period. But in a bullish market, you will lose the potential gains over the strike price.
