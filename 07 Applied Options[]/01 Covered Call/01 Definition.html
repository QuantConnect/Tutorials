A Covered Call is an options strategy that involves both underlying stock and an options contract. The trader buys (or already owns) a stock, then sells call options for the same amount of stock. The aim of the Covered Call is to gain profits from option premium by selling calls written on the stock you already owned. At any time for US options or at expiration for European options, if the stock moves below the strike price, you can keep the premium and still maintain the stock position. If the price moves above the strike, the options contract is exercised you will sell the stock at the strike price but still keep the premium. The risk of a Covered Call also comes from the long stock position, which could drop.
