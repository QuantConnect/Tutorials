 Bull Call Spread is an options strategy involving two call option contracts with the same expiration but different strikes. The strategy buys one call option with a lower strike and sells another call option with a higher strike price.

<p>
 This strategy creates a ceiling and floor for the profit. By purchasing a call and selling a call with higher strike simultaneously, traders can reduce the cost of just one long call option with the premium of a short call option. But the premium of ITM call is more expensive than the OTM call. The strategy limits the loss resulting from a drop in the price of the underlying stock but still creates a ceiling to the profit while the underlying price is increasing.

 Take GOOG as an example. If the share price of GOOG is $950 at time 0, the premium of ITM call option is 20 with strike 900 and the premium of OTM call option is 2 with strike 1000. If we ignore the commission, dividends and other transaction fees, the payoff of Bull Call Spread strategy is as follows:

<div class="section-example-container">

<pre class="python">price = np.arange(800,1100,1)
k_low = 900 # lower strike price for call
k_high = 1000 # higher strike price for call
premium_low = 20 # premium of call option with lower strike
premium_high = 2 # premium of call option with higher strike
# long call with lower strike
payoff_long_call = [max(-premium, i-k_low-premium_low ) for i in price]
# short call with higher strike
payoff_short_call = [min(premium, -(i-k_high-premium_high)) for i in price]
payoff = np.sum([payoff_long_call, payoff_short_call], axis=0)
plt.figure(figsize=(20,11))
plt.plot(price, payoff_long_call, label = 'long call')
plt.plot(price, payoff_short_call, label = 'short call')
plt.plot(price, payoff, label = 'Bull Call Spread')

 From the payoff plot we can see, the maximum payoff of the strategy is the difference between the option strike prices minus the difference between the premiums.
