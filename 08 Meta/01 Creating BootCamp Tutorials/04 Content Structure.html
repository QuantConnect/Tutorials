<p>
BootCamp is divided into <i>Courses</i>, <i>Lessons</i>, and <i>Tasks</i>.  A <i>Course</i> groups together a super-category and is currently organized by asset-class. A <i>Lesson</i> focuses on the implementation of a single algorithm.   A <i>Task</i> breaks up the algorithm implementation into tiny steps which can each be easily coded, with the aim of guiding the user through each layer of the algorithm design.

<h4>Core Principle</h4>
<p>The central guiding principle of BootCamp lessons is they are focused on the implementation of a single algorithmic trading strategy. At each level of the system, the titles should be directly related to the implementation of the strategy, not the concepts it is covering. This is actually quite difficult, but one way to help to get into this mindset is to focus on teaching how to implement the strategy.</p>

<h4>Course</h4>
<p>
A course is a collection of <i>Lessons</i> at a similar difficulty level, relating to a similar strategy topic. If you have a Boot Camp submission which requires another <i>Course</i> please let us know and we'll create one for you.
</p>

<h4>Lessons</h4>
<p>
A Lesson is a collection of tasks aiming to implement a single algorithmic strategy step by step. A lesson should be comprised of about 6-12 tasks, where each task builds upon the lessons learned from the previous task. We have built a system for the community to design and submit Boot Camp lessons and tasks.
</p>

<h4>Tasks</h4>
<p>
A Task is the atomic unit of the Boot Camp system. It is a single step required to be completed in the pathway to an algorithm. Tasks are grouped with a subheading according to algorithm implementation concept.
