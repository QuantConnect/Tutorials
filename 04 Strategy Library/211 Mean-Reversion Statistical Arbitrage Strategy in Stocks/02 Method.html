<h3>Step 1: Select our universe</h3> 
<p>
  We will select our universe of stocks by dropping securities with prices lower than $5 and pick the ones with the highest dollar traded volume.   
</P>

<div class="section-example-container">
<pre class="python">
  # Sort the equities in DollarVolume decendingly
  selected = sorted([x for x in coarse if x.Price > 5],
                    key=lambda x: x.DollarVolume, reverse=True)
  symbols = [x.Symbol for x in selected[:self.num_equities]]
</pre>
</div>

<h3>Step 2: Reduce dimensions to three principal components</h3>
<p>
  We want to minimize our algorithm's exposure to market factors. PCA is a procedure that extracts uncorrelated components of a possibly-correlated set of observations to reveal the factors that contribute most to a the variance of the observations. Applying PCA to the data above enables us to reduce dimensionality and select the most relevant market factors to shape our asset universe.
  Based on the results found in the cited paper, and for the sake of demonstration, we chose 3 components to account for the bulk of the variance.
  In our algorithm, the 3 principal components of the feature space are formed by the historical close values. 
</P>

<div class="section-example-container">
  <pre class="python">
  # Sample data for PCA (smooth it using np.log function)
  sample = np.log(history.dropna(axis=1))
  sample -= sample.mean() # Center it column-wise

  # Fit the PCA model for sample data
  model = PCA().fit(sample)

  # Get the first n_components factors
  factors = np.dot(sample, model.components_.T)[:,:self.num_components]
  </pre>
</div>

<h3>Step 3: Measure price deviation</h3>  
<p>
  We will model the mean-reverting residuals of our assets from a regression line. 
  We use linear regression to derive the weight of each stock in the portfolio based on its price deviation, which is measured by the residual. 
  If the absolute value of a stock's residual is large, it means that the level of price deviation is high and we should give it 
  more weight in the portfolio. Similarly, if the absolute value of the residual is small,
  it is reasonable to give the stock less weight in the portfolio. To facilitate this, we can first standardize the residuals to get 
  their z-scores. Then, based on the z-scores, it is easy to detect the level of price deviation. 
  Specifically, the level of deviation is higher when the absolute values of the z-scores are large. 
  From this it is natural to use the inverse of the absolute values of the z-scores as a measurement of the weights of the portfolio. 
</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
  <pre class="python">
    # Train Ordinary Least Squares linear model for each stock
    OLSmodels = {ticker: sm.OLS(sample[ticker], factors).fit() for ticker in sample.columns}

    # Get the residuals from the linear regression after PCA for each stock
    resids = pd.DataFrame({ticker: model.resid for ticker, model in OLSmodels.items()})

    # Get the Z scores by standarize the given pandas dataframe X
    zscores = ((resids - resids.mean()) / resids.std()).iloc[-1] # residuals of the most recent day

    # Get the stocks far from mean (for mean reversion)
    selected = zscores[zscores < -1.5]

    # Return the weights for each selected stock
    weights = selected * (1 / selected.abs().sum())
  </pre>
