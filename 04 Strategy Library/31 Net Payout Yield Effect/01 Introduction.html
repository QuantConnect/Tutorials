  Dividends are not the only way for a company to distribute their excess cash back to shareholders; stock repurchases are now a popular method. The net payout yield takes these two indicators, along with common share issuances and market capitalization, to provide a ratio showing how cheap a stock is compared to the stream of cash going back to the shareholders. This takes looking at dividend yields to a deeper level, considering alternative forms of cash redistribution as well.
