  This strategy is called Short-Term Reversal Strategy which is discussed in detail in the paper written by Wilma de Groot, Joop Huij and Weili Zhou (2011) titled "<strong><em>Another look at trading costs and short-term reversal profits</em></strong>". The standard reversal strategy takes the whole universe of stocks into consideration, while this paper limits the stock universe only to large cap stocks so that trading costs could be significantly reduced.

  One simple version of this strategy could be described like this: The investment universe consists of 100 biggest companies by market capitalization. We go long on the 10% stocks which have the?lowest performances in the last month while going short on the 10% stocks with the highest ones. The portfolio is rebalanced weekly.
  In the paper, however, strategies with different investment universes and different rebalancing frequencies are all backtested. The results show that, the larger the size of the investment universe, the larger the trading costs caused by extensively trading in small cap stocks which are less liquid; and trading costs become substantially lower when the rebalancing frequency is decreased from daily to weekly, but so do gross returns.
  In this tutorial, we only use 100 stocks with weekly rebalancing for illustration.
