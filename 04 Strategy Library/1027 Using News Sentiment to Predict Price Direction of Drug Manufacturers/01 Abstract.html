  Several studies have found that press releases and other media can impact the perspective of investors. In this 
  tutorial, we implement an intraday strategy to capitalize on the upward drift in the stock prices of drug 
  manufacturers following positive news releases. Our findings show that when combining the effect with the 
  day-of-the-week anomaly documented by Berument & Kiymaz (2001), there is enough directional accuracy for the 
  trading system to remain profitable throughout the 2020 stock market crash. The algorithm we design here is 
  inspired by the work of Isah, Shah, & Zulkernine (2018).
