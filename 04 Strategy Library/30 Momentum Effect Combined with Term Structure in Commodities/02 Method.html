<h4>Roll Return</h4>
<p>
  The universe is created with 22 commodity futures. For multiple commodities, we save the future chain of each commodity in dictionary <code>self.chains<code>.
  First, we compute the roll-returns at the start of each month and sort the roll-return list. 1/3 breakpoints are used to split the cross-section of futures contracts into 3 portfolios, labeled <code>Low</code>, <code>Med</code> and <code>High</code>. For the formula of the roll-return, please see <a href="https://www.quantconnect.com/tutorials/strategy-library/term-structure-effect-in-commodities">Term Structure Effect in Commodities</a>.
  Contracts fall into <code>Med</code> level are eliminated from the universe. Next we'll calculate the mean return of contracts in <code>High</code> and <code>Low</code>.

<pre class="python">
roll_return = {}
for symbol, chain in self.chains.items():
    contracts = sorted(chain, key = lambda x: x.Expiry)
    expiry_nearest = contracts[0].Expiry
    price_nearest = float(contracts[0].LastPrice) if contracts[0].LastPrice>0 else 0.5*float(contracts[0].AskPrice+contracts[0].BidPrice)
    for x in contracts[1:]:
        roll_return[x] = (price_nearest-float(x.LastPrice))*365 / (x.Expiry-expiry_nearest).days
sorted_by_roll_return = sorted(roll_return, key = lambda x: roll_return[x], reverse =True)
tertile = floor(1/3*len(sorted_by_roll_return))
high = sorted_by_roll_return[:tertile]
low = sorted_by_roll_return[-tertile:]
</pre>
</div>
<h4>Mean Return</h4>
<p>
  The second filter is the historical mean return.  We sort the contracts in the High portfolio into two sub-portfolios (High-Winner and High-Loser) based on the mean return of the commodities over the past one month.
High-Winner is thus made of the commodities that have both the highest roll-returns at the time of portfolio construction and the best past performance.
Similarly, we sort the commodities in the Low portfolio into two sub-portfolios (Low-Winner and Low-Loser) based on their mean return over the past one months. Low-Loser contains, therefore, commodities that have both the lowest roll-returns at the time of portfolio construction and the worst past performance.

mean_return_high = {}
for i in high:
    hist = self.History(i.Symbol, timedelta(days = 21), Resolution.Minute)

        continue
    hist_close = hist['close'][i.Expiry][i.Symbol.Value]
    mean_return_high[i] = np.mean(hist_close.pct_change())
high_winners = sorted(mean_return_high, key = lambda x: mean_return_high[x], reverse=True)[:int(len(high)*0.5)]

for i in low:
    hist = self.History(i.Symbol, timedelta(days = 21), Resolution.Minute)
    if hist.empty:
        continue
    hist_close = hist['close'][i.Expiry][i.Symbol.Value]
    mean_return_low[i] = np.mean(hist_close.pct_change())
low_losers = sorted(mean_return_low, key = lambda x: mean_return_low[x], reverse=True)[-int(len(low)*0.5):]

<p>
The combined strategy buys the High-Winner portfolio, shorts the Low-Loser portfolio and holds this position for one month. At the start of the next month, the strategy liquidates the contracts invested and rebalances the portfolio.
