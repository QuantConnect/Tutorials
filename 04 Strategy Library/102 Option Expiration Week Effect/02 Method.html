  S&amp;P 100 index includes 102 leading U.S. stocks with exchange-listed options. The constituents represent almost 51% of the market capitalization of the U.S. equity market.
  Here we trade the S&amp;P 100 index ETF as a portfolio of U.S. large-cap stocks.

  In the next step, we add the options to get their expiration dates. The range of expiration dates should bigger enough to include the
  the contract which expires in this month.

def Initialize(self):
    self.SetStartDate(2007, 1, 1)
    self.SetEndDate(2018, 8, 1)
    self.SetCash(10000)
    self.AddEquity("OEF", Resolution.Minute)
    option = self.AddOption("OEF")
    option.SetFilter(-3, 3, timedelta(0), timedelta(days = 60))

<p>
  To get a list of expiration dates from the contracts in the current option chain, we can use <code>TradingCalendar</code> object.
  It allows us to filter the calendar days by the type <code>TradingDayType.OptionExpiration</code> and the start as well as the end date.
  The expiry at the top of the list is the most recent expiration date.
</p>
<p>
  The long position is opened at the start of the expiration week. Therefore, we use the scheduled event to fire the rebalance method every Monday.
  If the current Monday is in the expiration week, we long the S&amp;P 100 index ETF.

<div class="section-example-container">
<pre class="python">
def Rebalance(self):
    calendar = self.TradingCalendar.GetDaysByType(TradingDayType.OptionExpiration, self.Time, self.EndDate)
    expiries = [i.Date for i in calendar]
    if len(expiries) == 0: return
    self.lastest_expiry = expiries[0]

    if (self.lastest_expiry - self.Time).days <= 5:
        self.SetHoldings("OEF", 1)
</pre>

   The algorithm stays in cash during days out of the options expiration week.
