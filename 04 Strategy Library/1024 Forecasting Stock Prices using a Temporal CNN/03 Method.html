<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>
    Our strategy is to develop a Temporal Convolutional Neural Network model and train our model on historical OHLCV data
    to predict the movement of future prices. Then, when trading, we take the most recent data, feed it into our model, and
    bet on the direction of the price movement based on our model prediction. We will walk through the code required
    for building the Neural Network Architecture and for preparing the data for our model, as this part is the harder part to understand.
</p>

<h3>Inputs/Outputs</h3>

<p>
    Before we build our Neural Network Architecture, we need to understand the inputs and outputs to our model.
    The input to the model will be the OHLC+Volume data for t-14 to t time steps (past 15 time steps). The output is a
    direction (Up, Down, Stationary) of the movement of the average close of the t+1 to t+5 time steps (5 future timestamps).
    The movement is considered stationary if the abs(% change 5-step average close) < .01%. These three directions will
    form the labels for which our model will try to classify, thus we have a <em>classification</em> problem.
</p>


<h3>Neural Network Model Architecture</h3>

<p>
    Now, we will need to build our Neural Network Architecture, which we will build using <a href="https://keras.io/">Keras</a>,
    a high-level Python Deep Learning API. To begin, we will need a few import statements:
</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
<pre class="python">
    import tensorflow as tf
    from tensorflow.keras.layers import Input, Conv1D, Dense, Lambda, Flatten, Concatenate
    from tensorflow.keras import Model
    from tensorflow.keras import metrics
    from tensorflow.keras.losses import CategoricalCrossentropy
    from tensorflow.keras import utils
    from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
    import numpy as np
    import math
</pre>
</div>


<p>
    We start with an Input Layer, where training and testing data are initially accepted. With 15 time steps and 5 input
    variables (OHLCV), our input shape will be 15 x 5.
</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
<pre class="python">
    inputs = Input(shape=(15, 5))
</pre>
</div>


<p>
    We then feed this Layer into our Convolutional Layer, where we extract features, which will serve as
    the Neural Network's method of extracting patterns from the time-series data.
</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
<pre class="python">
    feature_extraction = Conv1D(30, 4, activation='relu')(inputs)
</pre>
</div>


<div class="section-example-container">
<pre class="python">
    long_term = Lambda( lambda x: tf.split(x, num_or_size_splits=3, axis=1)[0])(feature_extraction)
    mid_term = Lambda( lambda x: tf.split(x, num_or_size_splits=3, axis=1)[1])(feature_extraction)
    short_term = Lambda( lambda x: tf.split(x, num_or_size_splits=3, axis=1)[2])(feature_extraction)

    long_term_conv = Conv1D(1, 1, activation='relu')(long_term)
    mid_term_conv = Conv1D(1, 1, activation='relu')(mid_term)
    short_term_conv = Conv1D(1, 1, activation='relu')(short_term)
</pre>
</div>


<p>
    These three layers are then combined, and since we will be working with 2D input matrices, we will then need to flatten
    our layer.
</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
<pre class="python">
    combined = Concatenate(axis=1)([long_term_conv, mid_term_conv, short_term_conv])
    flattened = Flatten()(combined)
</pre>
</div>


<p>
    Our final layer will be our output layer, and since we have three outputs (Up, Stationary, Down),
    this layer will have three nodes.
</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
<pre class="python">
    outputs = Dense(3, activation='softmax')(flattened)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
    The resulting Neural Network Architecture is shown in the following:

<h3>Preparing the Data for Our Model</h3>

<p>
    First, we need to define a class and a few variables:
</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
<pre class="python">
    input_vars = ['open', 'high', 'low', 'close', 'volume']

    class Direction:
        UP = 0
        DOWN = 1
        STATIONARY = 2

    rolling_avg_window_size = 5

    shift = -(rolling_avg_window_size-1)

    stationary_threshold = .0001

    scaler = StandardScaler()
</pre>
</div>

<p>
    <em>input_vars</em> define the variables we want to use to make our predictions. The class <em>Direction</em>
    defines a few integers that we will label our data with (labels are needed for classification problems). The reason
    we use integers instead of strings is because Keras, like most ML libraries, only work with numerical data. Moving on,
    <em>rolling_avg_window_size</em> is the number of time steps used for the calculate the average of future closing prices,
    described earlier in
    <b>Inputs/Outputs</b> (t+1 to t+5 is 5 time steps, thus this value accordingly is set to 5).
    The constant <em>stationary_threshold</em> defines the threshold for a change in price to be considered
    stationary, and this change also described in <b>Inputs/Outputs</b>. The <em>shift</em> is the shift needed to align
    the average value (mentioned earlier), in our pandas DataFrame to make it easier for us to slice our DataFrame into pieces
    manageable for our Neural Network model. The <em>scaler</em> object will be used later to scale our data.
    The purpose of the variables will become clearer in use.
<p>
    Next, say we are at time t in the pandas DataFrame, to calculate the average closing prices of t+1 to t+5, and calculate
    the percent change from the close at t, we use the following lines of code:
</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
<pre class="python">
    df['close_avg'] = df['close'].rolling(window=rolling_avg_window_size).mean().shift(shift)
    df['close_avg_change_pct'] = (df['close_avg'] - df['close']) / df['close']
</pre>
</div>

<p>
    The rolling mean should be self explanatory for those familiar with pandas (if not, I hope by now readers realize
    this is a more advanced resource).
    Here, <em>.shift(shift)</em> aligns the five time step rolling average <em>'close_avg'</em> column to the end of the last
    time step we want to use as an input for prediction, and this action will make slicing up the DataFrame into input
    and labeled data for our model much easier.
</p>

<p>
    To label our data, we need to first define a function that we will use with the DataFrame's <em>apply()</em> method.
    Usually, lambda functions are used for this purpose, however, our function's logic will not fit inside a lambda.
</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
<pre class="python">
    def label_data(row):
        if row['close_avg_change_pct'] > stationary_threshold:
            return Direction.UP
        elif row['close_avg_change_pct'] < -stationary_threshold:
            return Direction.DOWN
        else:
            return Direction.STATIONARY
</pre>
</div>

<p>
    Now, we apply the above function to our DataFrame to get a column of labels:
</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
<pre class="python">
    df['movement_labels'] = df.apply(label_data, axis=1)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
    With our labels in place, we can now slice up our DataFrame into pieces manageable for our model and collect them into
    lists:
</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
<pre class="python">
    data = []
    labels = []

    for i in range(len(df)-self.n_tsteps+1+shift):
        label = df['movement_labels'].iloc[i+self.n_tsteps-1]
        data.append(df[input_vars].iloc[i:i+self.n_tsteps].values)
        labels.append(label)

    data = np.array(data)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
    Here, we iterate numerically through the DataFrame, with a carefully calculated value in our <em>range()</em>
    function to make sure we do access an out-of-bounds index. We cast the list of numpy arrays to a numpy array because
    Keras works best with numpy arrays.
</p>

<p>
    Now, we need to scale our data. It is good practice to scale data when using Machine Learning models so that the
    range of values is normalized across the features.
</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
<pre class="python">
    dim1, dim2, dim3 = data.shape
    data = data.reshape(dim1*dim2, dim3)
    data = scaler.fit_transform(data)
    data = data.reshape(dim1, dim2, dim3)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
    The reason we reshape the data before the scaling is because sklearn is only able to handle 2D data, but right after,
    we can return the data to the original shape with another reshaping.
</p>

<p>
    Finally, since Keras requires the labels to be dummified (which essentially turns a list of labels into a matrix of
    1s and 0s, where the index of the 1 is equal to the value of the integer label), we use the following:
</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
<pre class="python">
    labels = utils.to_categorical(labels, num_classes=3)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
    Specifying <em>num_classes</em> to 3 ensures our matrix will have three columns, one for each label (Up, Down, Stationary).
</p>

<p>
    We have now finished the walk through of the difficult parts of the code.
</p>

<h3>Trading</h3>

<p>
    After we feed in the prepared data into the model (the corresponding code, as well as the rest of the code, can be
    found in <b>Algorithm</b>) we can
    use our model to make predictions. We take the most recent 15 bars of OHLCV data and apply our model on it to make
    a prediction. If the model predicts with above 55% confidence that the future direction is up (resp. down), we emit
    an Price Insight with direction <em>InsightDirection.Up</em> (resp. <em>InsightDirection.Down</em>). Since we are
    betting on the direction of the average of the future five closing prices, it would be intuitive to emit an Insights
    in the respective direction for <em>timedeltas</em> of one through five. However, we choose to only emit an Insight
    with a <em>timedelta</em> with a random integer between one and five to constrain the number of insights we emit.
</p>


<h3>The Rest</h3>

<p>
    We have covered the difficult aspects of the code, as well as give an overview of our strategy. The rest of the
    necessary code to execute the strategy can be found in <b>Algorithm</b>.
