For the backtest period (January 1998 to September 2019), the trend following strategy produced a Sharpe ratio of 0.273, compared to SPY’s Sharpe ratio of 0.459. The positive performance of the trend-following strategy over the approximately 20-year time horizon indeed suggests the existence of statistically significant, anomalous, systematic, excess returns from trends. Furthermore, the paper suggests the anomaly is universal across 3 other asset classes (currencies, stock indices and bonds).

This tutorial demonstrates trends as one of the most powerful sources of anomalous excess returns in financial markets. We hope to inspire the community to develop more trend-based strategies and encourage you to test out this strategy on other asset classes from the original paper.
