<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portfolio_optimization">Portfolio Optimization</a> is the process of choosing asset allocation ratios to select the best portfolio according to some objective. For example, for investors looking to minimize the risk of their portfolio, an investor can set out to minimize a risk metric, such as <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/investing/beta-know-risk/#:~:text=Beta%20is%20a%20measure%20of,has%20a%20beta%20above%201.0.">Beta</a> or <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/var.asp">Value at Risk</a>. In our <a href="https://www.quantconnect.com/tutorials/strategy-library/optimal-pairs-trading">Optimal Pairs Trading algorithm</a>, our objective was to maximize the fit of a portfolio of GLD and SLV to an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, which we measured using Maximum Likelihood Estimation. The strategy we discuss today will seek to maximize the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sharperatio.asp">Sharpe Ratio</a> in an attempt to achieve a portfolio that achieves desirable risk-adjusted returns. However, it should be noted to investors that since the metrics are obtained through a fit to past data, there is no guarantee that the portfolio will behave in a similar fashion in the future. This can be partially addressed by choosing metrics and a combination of assets that lead to strong autocorrelation in the metric values, however, we leave this as a suggestion for future research.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moving on, there are a few ways to determine the optimal asset allocations. The simplest way is to all possible combinations of asset allocations ratios discretized to values between 0 and 1. To illustrate, say we discretize allocation ratios using an increment of .01, and say we are testing allocation ratios for two assets, A1 and A2, we&rsquo;d first test 1.00 for A1 and 0.00 for A2, and compute the objective, then we&rsquo;d test 0.99 for A1 and .44 for A2, and compute the objective, and repeat this method until the objective values for all combinations are calculated. Then, we can choose the allocation ratios that lead to the most optimal objective value. However, this iterative method can be quite slow, and the runtime grows exponentially with each newly added asset. Thus, several alternative methods have been developed to tackle optimization, such as Newton and Quasi-Newton optimization algorithms. In our strategy, we leverage a Deep Neural Network with Adam Optimizer to determine the asset allocations for optimal Sharpe.</p>
