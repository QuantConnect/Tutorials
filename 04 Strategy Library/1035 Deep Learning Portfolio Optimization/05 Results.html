    We benchmark the performance of this algorithm against the S&P500 index, which we track using SPY. Over the five years from October 2015 to October 2020, the algorithm achieved a Sharpe Ratio of 1.032, while SPY achieved a Sharpe Ratio of 0.769 over the same period. Furthermore, our algorithm had a relatively low drawdown during the drawdown in March.
