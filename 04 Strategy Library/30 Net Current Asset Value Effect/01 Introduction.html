  The net current asset value per share (NCAV/MV) is a key metric for value investors. NCAV/MV is the balance sheet current assets minus all the firm's (current and long-term) liabilities divided by the number of shares outstanding. This rule forms portfolios filled with stocks with market capitalization lower than the amount of cash plus inventories they own. A lot of these stocks are so cheap because the companies are in distress and will eventually go bankrupt. But the rest of the stocks bought with an extreme discount statistically gain more and the overall portfolio return is highly positive.
