<h2>Introduction</h2>
In the last chapter we introduced Capital Asset Pricing Model(CAPM), which used market return as a factor to explain the return of the measured asset. In this chapter we will expand the single-factor model into multi-factor models, which use more factor to price an asset. Multi-factor models can be written in the following forms:
\[r_A = \alpha + \beta_1f_1 + \beta_2f_2 + \beta_3f_3 +...+\beta_nf_n\]
Where \(f_i\) is the factor \(i\) and \(\beta_i\) is the coefficient, or beta of factor \(i\).
<h2>Fama-French Three-Factor Model</h2>
This factor is designed by <strong>Eugene Fama</strong> and <strong>Kenneth French</strong> to describe stock returns. They proposed this model in their research in 1993,[ref] <strong>Fama, E. F.; French, K. R.</strong> (1993). "Common risk factors in the returns on stocks and bonds". Journal of Financial Economics. 33: 3. CiteSeerX 10.1.1.139.5892 Freely accessible. doi:10.1016/0304-405X(93)90023-5[/ref] and thereafter this model are commonly used to replace CAPM.

The model is given by:
\[r = \alpha + \beta_mMKT + \beta_sSMB + \beta_hHML + \epsilon\]
Where \(MKT\), \(SMB\) \(HML\) are the three factors.

\(MKT\) is the market factor and it represents the excess return on the market[ref]Kenneth's Website <a href="http://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/Data_Library/f-f_factors.html">Link</a>[/ref]. It's a value-weight return of all CRSP firms incorporated in the US and listed on the NYSE, AMEX, or NASDAQ minus the one-month Treasure bill rate.

\(SMB\) is short for 'Small Minus Big', which represents the small cap stocks beat the large cap stocks.

\(HML\) is short for 'High Minus Low'. It represents the stocks with high B/P values(book value to market price) outperform the stocks with low B/P values. The high B/P stocks are also called <strong>"value stocks".</strong> Correspondently, the low B/P ones are called <strong>"growth stocks"</strong>.

The details of how these factors are calculated can be found on<a href="http://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/Data_Library/f-f_factors.html"> Kenneth's website</a>. This is also the source of the Fama-French factors.
<h2>Model test</h2>
In order to test the model significance and the economics intuition behind it, we used NASDAQ US Small Cap Index and NASDAQ US Large Cap Index to fit the three-factor model. We used daily data in the past six years to do the regression.
The following table is the regression results from the small caps:
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2206" src="https://www.quantconnect.com/tutorials/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screen-Shot-2017-08-01-at-5.20.02-PM.png" alt="" width="1342" height="830" />As we expected, the exposure to, or the coefficient of the SMB factor is positive, which means when the small stocks beat the large stocks, it positively contributes to the return. Compared with the HML factor, the absolute values of factor MKT and SMB are obviously larger. Given that the values of the three factor are under the same scale, we know that MKT and SMB are the decisive factors for the small cap index.

&nbsp;

Now let's check the result for large caps below:

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2205" src="https://www.quantconnect.com/tutorials/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screen-Shot-2017-08-01-at-5.18.48-PM.png" alt="" width="1346" height="822" />

Not surprisingly, The SMB factor is negative for the large cap index. The reason is straightforward: when small stocks outperform big stocks, the big stocks performs relatively bad thus the index has a lower return. The coefficient of HML factor is still very low, the reason is the value stocks and growth stocks takes approximately the same weight in the index portfolio.
<h2>Risk Premia</h2>
What if we want to know know the return on a single factor? We can achieve this purpose by construct a <strong>tracking portfolio</strong>. For example, if we want a tracking portfolio of the HML factor, we only need to find 4 stocks to construct a portfolio that has zero coefficients on the MKT and SMB factor and 1 coefficient on the HML factor. Generally, if we have stock A, B, C, and D, who's return can be explain by the three factor model:
\[r_A = \alpha_A + \beta_{11}MKT + \beta_{12}SMB + \beta_{13}HML\]
\[r_B = \alpha_B + \beta_{21}MKT + \beta_{22}SMB + \beta_{23}HML\]
\[...\]
And their weight in the portfolio are represented by \((w_A,w_B,w_C,w_D\)). We write the coefficients into a matrix:
\[\Sigma = \begin{pmatrix}
\alpha_{1} &amp; \beta_{11}&amp;\beta_{12}&amp;\beta_{13} \\
\alpha_{2} &amp;\beta_{21}&amp;\beta_{22}&amp;\beta_{23} \\
\alpha_{3}&amp;\beta_{31}&amp;\beta_{32}&amp;\beta_{33}\\
\alpha_{4}&amp;\beta_{41}&amp;\beta_{42}&amp;\beta_{43}
\end{pmatrix}\]
We just need to solve the following linear equations:
\[w\Sigma = \begin{pmatrix}
0\\0\\0\\1
\end{pmatrix}\quad\]
By constructing a tracking portfolio, we can track a specific factor's return. Subtracting risk-free rate from the return, we get <strong>risk premia</strong> of this factor.

Economically, any idiosyncratic risk, or firm specified risk, can be diversified away. The Market risk in CAPM, and the exposure to the three FF factor in the multi-factor model, are systematic risk which can't be diversified away. Risk premia of a factor measure the risk premium above the risk-free for the investor to take this risk.
<h2>Other Factors</h2>
Although the FF three factors are the most import factors(by far), there are still some popular factors.

Momentum is a commonly used one, which represents 'winners' significantly outperform 'losers'.

Profitability is another factor proposed by Novy-Marx(2013)[ref]<strong>Robert Novy-Marx(2013)</strong> The Other Side of Value: The Gross Profitability Premium Journal of Financial Economics 108 (1), 1-28 <a href="http://rnm.simon.rochester.edu/research/OSoV.pdf">Online Copy</a>[/ref]. It represents the firms with high operating profit margin outperform the less profitable firms. ' Controlling for gross profitability explains most earnings related anomalies, and a wide range of seemingly unrelated profitable trading strategies'. Nove-Marx explained this factor in his paper. Now the profitability has been incorporated in the 'Fama-French empirical 5-factor model', and this factor is called 'RMW'(robust minus weak).

Another factor in the 5-factor model is CMA(conservative minus aggressive). It represents the firms investing less(conservative) outperform the firms investing a lot. Fama and French(2014)[ref]<strong>Fama, E. F.; French, K. R. (2015)</strong>.A Five-Factor Asset Pricing Model. 116: 1–22. doi:10.1016/j.jfineco.2014.10.010 <a href="https://www8.gsb.columbia.edu/programs/sites/programs/files/finance/Finance%20Seminar/spring%202014/ken%20french.pdf">Online Copy</a>[/ref] pointed out in their paper that 'A five-factor model directed at capturing the size, value, profitability, and investment patterns in average stock returns is rejected on the GRS test, but for applied purposes it provides an acceptable description of average returns'.
This means the SMB, HML, RMW and CMA factors capture size, value, profitability and investment pattern respectively. This made the FF 5 factor-model the latest and one of the most powerful asset pricing model so far.
<h2>Summary</h2>
In this chapter we expand Capital Asset Pricing Model(CAPM) into multi-factor models, and introduced Fama-French factor models, which are the most empirically successful multi-factor models by far, and they are commonly used both in practice and in academic.
<h2>Algorithm</h2>
Multi-factor strategies are usually <strong>stock picking</strong> strategy. Here we try to implement a paper published by AQR Capital Management in 2013: A New Core Equity Paradigm.[ref]<strong>AQR</strong>: A New Core Equity Paradigm: Using Value, Momentum, and Quality to Outperform Markets.<a href="https://www.aqr.com/~/media/files/papers/aqr-a-new-core-equity-paradigm.pdf ">Online Copy</a>[/ref]

The main idea of the paper is to pick stocks by their value, quality and momentum.

The empirically successful measure of value is book-to-price(B/P), but the paper points out that other measures can be used and applied simultaneously to form a more robust and reliable view of a stock's value. The paper uses five measures: book-to-price, earnings-to-price(EPS), forecasted EPS, Cash flow-to-enterprise value and sales-to-enterprise value.

Quality means profitability. Similarly, the paper used multiple quality measures - total profit over assets, gross margin and free cash flow over assets - to capture different aspects of a firm's profitability.
