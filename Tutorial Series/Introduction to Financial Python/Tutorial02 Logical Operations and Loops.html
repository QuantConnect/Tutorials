<h2>Introduction</h2>
We discussed the basic data types and data structures in Python in the last tutorial. In this chapter we will cover logical operations and loops in python, which are extremely important in programming.
<h2>Logical Operation</h2>
<h3>Logic Operators</h3>
As we mentioned in the last tutorial, a boolean value is either True or False, and it can't be anything else. logical operators deal with boolean values. The operators are == (equal), != (not equal), &lt; (less than), &gt; (greater than), &lt;= (no bigger than), &gt;= (no less than).
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">print 1 == 0
print 1 == 1
print 1 != 0
print 5 &gt;= 5
print 5 &gt;= 6
[out]:
False
True
True
True
False
</pre>
We can make complex logical statements using logical operators 'and', 'or', and 'not'.
The logic 'P and Q' is true only if both P and Q are true, otherwise this statement is False.
The logic 'P or Q' is false only if both P and Q are false, otherwise this statement is True.
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">print 2 &gt; 1 and 3 &gt; 2
print 2 &gt; 1 and 3 &lt; 2
print 2 &gt; 1 or 3 &lt; 2
print 2 &lt; 1 and 3 &lt; 2
[out]:
True
False
True
False
</pre>
If we are dealing with a very complex logical statement that involves in several statements, we can use brackets to separate and combine them.
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">print (3 &gt; 2 or 1 &lt; 3) and (1!=3 and 4&gt;3) and not ( 3 &lt; 2 or 1 &lt; 3 and (1!=3 and 4&gt;3))
print 3 &gt; 2 or 1 &lt; 3 and (1!=3 and 4&gt;3) and not ( 3 &lt; 2 or 1 &lt; 3 and (1!=3 and 4&gt;3))
[out]:
False
True
</pre>
Comparing the above two statements, we can see that it's wise to use brackets when we make a complex logical statement.
<h3>If Statement</h3>
An if statement let us to execute a segment of code only if the statement is true. A standard if statement contains three segments: if, elif and else.
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">if statement1:
    # if the statement1 is true, execute the code here.
    # code.....
    # code.....
elif statement2:
    # if the statement 1 is false, skip the codes above to this part.
    # code......
    # code......
else:
    # if none of the above statements is True, skip to this part
    # code......
</pre>
An if statement doesn't necessarily has elif and else part. If it's not specified, the indented block of code will be executed when the statement is true, otherwise the whole if statement will be skipped.
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">i = 0
if i == 0:
    print 'i==0 is True'
[out]: i==0 is True
</pre>
As we mentioned above, we can write some complex statements here:
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">p = 1 &gt; 0
q = 2 &gt; 3
if p and q:
    print 'p and q is true'
elif p and not q:
    print 'q is false'
elif q and not p:
    print 'p is false'
else:
    print 'None of p and q is true'
[out]: q is false
</pre>
<h2>Loop Structures</h2>
Loop is the most important part of programming. The for loop and while loop provide a way to run a block of code repeatedly.
<h3>While Loop</h3>
A while loop will run repeatedly until a certain condition has been met.
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">i = 0
while i &lt; 5:
    print i
    i += 1
[out]:
0
1
2
3
4
</pre>
When making a while loop, we need to ensure that something changes from iteration to iteration so that the while loop will terminates, otherwise it will run infinitely. Here we used shorthand i += 1 (short for i = i + 1) to make i larger after each iteration. This is the most commonly used method to control a while loop.
<h3>For Loop</h3>
A for loop will iterate over a sequence of value and terminate when the sequence has ended.
The keywords of a for loop is 'for' and 'in'.
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">for i in [1,2,3,4,5]:
    print i
[out]:
1
2
3
4
5
</pre>
We can also add if statements in a for loop. Here is a real example from our pairs trading algorithm:
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">stocks = ['AAPL','GOOG','IBM','FB','F','V', 'G', 'GE']
selected = ['AAPL','IBM']
new_list = []
for i in stocks:
    if i not in selected:
        new_list.append(i)
print stocks
[out]: ['AAPL', 'GOOG', 'IBM', 'FB', 'F', 'V', 'G', 'GE']
</pre>
Here we iterated all the elements in the list 'stocks'. Later in this chapter we will introduce a smarter way to do this, which is just an one-line code.
There are two commonly used statements in a for loop: break and continue.
If break is encountered while a loop is executing, the loop will terminate immediately.
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">stocks = ['AAPL','GOOG','IBM','FB','F','V', 'G', 'GE']
for i in stocks:
    print i
    if i == 'FB':
        break
[out]:
AAPL
GOOG
IBM
FB
</pre>
Continue statement tells the loop to end this iteration and skip to the next iteration.
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">stocks = ['AAPL','GOOG','IBM','FB','F','V', 'G', 'GE']
for i in stocks:
    if i == 'FB':
        continue
    print i
[out]:
AAPL
GOOG
IBM
F
V
G
GE
</pre>
By using break and continue, we can accomplish complex tasks in a for loop.
<h2>List Comprehension</h2>
List comprehension is a Pythonic way to create lists. Common applications are to make new lists where each element is the result of some operations applied to each member of another sequence. For example, if we want to create a list of squares using for loop:
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">squares = []
for i in [1,2,3,4,5]:
    squares.append(i**2)
print squares
[out]: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
</pre>
Using list comprehension:
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">list = [1,2,3,4,5]
squares = [x**2 for x in list]
print squares
[out]: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
</pre>
Recall the example above, we used a for loop to select stock. Here we use list comprehension:
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">stocks = ['AAPL','GOOG','IBM','FB','F','V', 'G', 'GE']
selected = ['AAPL','IBM']
new_list = [x for x in stocks if x in selected]
print new_list
[out]: ['AAPL', 'IBM']
</pre>
A list comprehension consists of brackets containing an expression followed by a for clause, then zero or more for or if clauses. For example:
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">print [(x, y) for x in [1,2,3] for y in [3,1,4] if x != y]
print [str(x)+' vs '+str(y) for x in ['AAPL','GOOG','IBM','FB'] for y in ['F','V','G','GE'] if x!=y]
[out]:
[(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 4)]
['AAPL vs F', 'AAPL vs V', 'AAPL vs G', 'AAPL vs GE', 'GOOG vs F', 'GOOG vs V', 'GOOG vs G', 'GOOG vs GE', 'IBM vs F', 'IBM vs V', 'IBM vs G', 'IBM vs GE', 'FB vs F', 'FB vs V', 'FB vs G', 'FB vs GE']
</pre>
List comprehension is an elegant way to organize one or many for loops if the purpose is to create a list.
<h2>Summary</h2>
In this chapter we introduced logical operation, for/while loop and list comprehension, which is an elegant and pythonic way to write a for loop inside a list. Next chapter we will introduce python functions and the concept of objective oriented programming, which will enable us to make our codes clean and versatile.
