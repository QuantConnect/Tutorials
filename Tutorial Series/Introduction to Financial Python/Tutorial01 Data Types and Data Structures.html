This tutorial provides a basic introduction to the Python programming language. If you are new to Python, you should run the code snippets while reading this tutorial. If you are an advanced Python user, please feel free to skip this chapter.

<h2>Basic Variable Types</h2>

The basic types of variables in Python are: strings, integers, floating point numbers and booleans.

Strings in python are identified as a contiguous set of characters represented in either single quotes (' ') or double quotes (" ").
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">my_string1 = 'Welcome to'
my_string2 = "QuantConnect"
print(my_string1 + ' ' + my_string2)
[out]: Welcome to QuantConnect
</pre>

An integer is a round number with no values after the decimal point.
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">my_int = 10
print(my_int)
[out]: 10
print(type(my_int))
[out]: type 'int'
</pre>

The built-in function int() can convert a string into an integer.
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">my_string = "100"
print(type(my_string))
[out]: type 'str'
my_int = int(my_string)
print(type(my_int))
[out]: type 'int'
</pre>

A floating point number, or a float, is a real number in mathematics. In Python we need to include a value after a decimal point to define it as a float.
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">my_float = 1.0
print(type(my_float))
[out]: type 'float'
my_int = 1
print(type(my_int))
[out]: type 'int'
</pre>

As you can see above, if we don't include a decimal value, the variable would be defined as an integer. The built-in function float() can convert a string or an integer into a float.
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">my_string = "100"
my_float = float(my_string)
print(type(my_float))
[out]: type 'float'
</pre>

A boolean, or bool, is a binary variable. Its value can only be True or False. It is useful when we do some logic operations, which would be covered in our next chapter.
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">my_bool = False
print(my_bool)
[out]: False
print(type(my_bool))
[out]: type 'bool'
</pre>

<h2>Basic Math Operations</h2>

The basic math operators in python are demonstrated below:
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
print("Addition ", 1+1)
print("Subtraction ", 5-2)
print("Multiplication ", 2*3)
print("Division", 10/2)
print("exponent", 2**3)
[out]:
Addition  2
Subtraction  3
Multiplication  6
Division  5
exponent 8
</pre>

<h2>Data Collections</h2>

<h3>List</h3>

A list is an <strong>ordered</strong> collection of values. A list is mutable, which means you can change a list's value without changing the list itself. Creating a list is simply putting different comma-separated values between square brackets.
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">my_list = ['Quant', 'Connect', 1,2,3]
print(my_list)
[out]: ['Quant', 'Connect', 1, 2, 3]
</pre>

The values in a list are called "elements". We can access list elements by indexing. Python index starts from 0. So if you have a list of length <em>n</em>, the index of the first element will be 0, and that of the last element will be <em>n</em> &minus; 1. By the way, the length of a list can be obtained by the built-in function len().
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">my_list = ['Quant', 'Connect', 1,2,3]
print(len(my_list))
[out]: 5
print(my_list[0])
[out]: Quant
print(my_list[len(my_list) - 1])
[out]: 3
</pre>

You can also change the elements in the list by accessing an index and assigning a new value.
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">my_list = ['Quant','Connect',1,2,3]
my_list[2] = 'go'
print(my_list)
[out]: ['Quant', 'Connect', 'go', 2, 3]
</pre>

A list can also be sliced with a colon:
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">my_list = ['Quant','Connect',1,2,3]
print(my_list[1:3])
[out]: ['Connect', 1]
</pre>

The slice starts from the first element indicated, but excludes the last element indicated. Here we select all elements starting from index 1, which refers to the second element:
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">print(my_list[1:])
[out]: ['Connect', 1, 2, 3]
</pre>

And all elements up to but excluding index 3:
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">print(my_list[:3])
[out]: ['Quant', 'Connect', 1]
</pre>

If you wish to add or remove an element from a list, you can use the append() and remove() methods for lists as follows:
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">my_list = ['Hello', 'Quant']
my_list.append('Hello')
print(my_list)
[out]: ['Hello', 'Quant', 'Hello']
my_list.remove('Hello')
print(my_list)
[out]: ['Quant', 'Hello']
</pre>

When there are repeated instances of "Hello", the first one is removed.

<h3>Tuple</h3>

A tuple is a data structure type similar to a list. The difference is that a tuple is immutable, which means you can't change the elements in it once it's defined. We create a tuple by putting comma-separated values between parentheses.
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">my_tuple = ('Welcome','to','QuantConnect')
</pre>

Just like a list, a tuple can be sliced by using index.
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">my_tuple = ('Welcome','to','QuantConnect')
print(my_tuple[1:])
[out]: ('to', 'QuantConnect')
</pre>

<h3>Set</h3>

A set is an <strong>unordered</strong> collection with <strong>no duplicate</strong> elements. The built-in function set() can be used to create sets.
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">stock_list = ['AAPL','GOOG','IBM','AAPL','IBM','FB','F','GOOG']
stock_set = set(stock_list)
print(stock_set)
[out]: set(['GOOG', 'FB', 'AAPL', 'IBM', 'F'])
</pre>
Set is an easy way to remove duplicate elements from a list.

<h3>Dictionary</h3>

A dictionary is one of the most important data structures in Python. Unlike sequences which are indexed by integers, dictionaries are indexed by keys which can be either strings or floats.

A dictionary is an <strong>unordered</strong> collection of key : value pairs, with the requirement that the keys are unique. We create a dictionary by placing a comma-separated list of key : value pairs within the braces.
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">my_dic = {'AAPL': 'Apple', 'FB': 'FaceBook', 'GOOG': 'Alphabet'}
</pre>

After defining a dictionary, we can access any value by indicating its key in brackets.
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">print(my_dic['GOOG'])
[out]: Alphabet
</pre>

We can also change the value associated with a specified key:
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">my_dic['GOOG'] = 'Alphabet Company'
print(my_dic['GOOG'])
[out]: Alphabet Company
</pre>

The built-in method of the dictionary object dict.keys() returns a list of all the keys used in the dictionary.
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">print(my_dic.keys())
[out]: ['GOOG', 'AAPL', 'FB']
</pre>

<h2>Common String Operations</h2>

A string is an immutable sequence of characters. It can be sliced by index just like a tuple:
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">my_str = 'Welcome to QuantConnect'
print(my_str[8:])
[out]: to QuantConnect
</pre>

There are many methods associated with strings. We can use string.count() to count the occurrences of a character in a string, use string.find() to return the index of a specific character, and use string.replace() to replace characters.
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
print("Counting the number of e's in this sentence".count('e'))
[out]: 6
print('The first time e appears in this sentence'.find('e'))
[out]: 2
print('all the a in this sentence now becomes e'.replace('a','e'))
[out]: ell the e in this sentence now becomes e
</pre>

The most commonly used method for strings is string.split(). This method will split the string by the indicated character and return a list:
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">Time = '2016-04-01 09:43:00'
splited_list = Time.split(' ')
date = splited_list[0]
time = splited_list[1]
print(date, time)
[out]: 2016-04-01 09:43:00
hour = time.split(':')[0]
print(hour)
[out]: 09
</pre>

We can replace parts of a string by our variable. This is called string formatting.
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">my_time = 'Hour: {}, Minute: {}'.format(9, 43)
print(my_time)
[out]: Hour: 9, Minute: 43
</pre>

Another way to format a string is to use the % symbol.
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">print 'pi is %f' % 3.14
[out]: pi is 3.140000
print('%s to %s' % ('Welcome', 'Quantconnect'))
[out]: Welcome to Quantconnect
</pre>

%s is a placeholder that takes in a string. Similarly %f takes a float and %d takes an integer.

<h2>Summary</h2>
