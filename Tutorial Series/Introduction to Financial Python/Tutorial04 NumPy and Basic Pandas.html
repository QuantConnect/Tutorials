<h2>Introduction</h2>
We have already introduced basic python part. Now let's take a look at NumPy and Pandas, which allow us to do something with math and data.

NumPy is the core library for scientific computing in Python. It provides a high-performance multidimensional array object, and tools for working with these array. It also has strong integration with Pandas, which is another power tool for manipulating financial data.

We introduced the concept of class in the last chapter. A python package is essentially a executable python script and we use the class and methods in the package by importing the script.

<h2>NumPy</h2>
<h3>Basic NumPy Arrays</h3>
A NumPy array is a grid of values, all of the same type, and is indexed by a tuple of nonnegative integers. Here we make an array by passing a list of Apple stock price:
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">price_list = [143.73, 145.83, 143.68, 144.02, 143.5, 142.62]
price_array = np.array(price_list)
print price_array, type(price_array)
[out]: [ 143.73  145.83  143.68  144.02  143.5   142.62]
</pre>
Notice that the type of array is 'ndarray'. This means it's a multiple-dimensional array. If we pass np.array() a list of lists, it will create a 2-dimensional array.
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">Ar = np.array([[1,3],[2,4]])
print Ar, type
[out]: [[1 3]
       [2 4]]
</pre>
We can access the dimensions of an array using the array.shape property:
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">print Ar.shape
[out]: (2, 2)
</pre>
If we create an 2-dimensional array, we call it a matrix, and each list is an vector. We can access to the list by index:
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">print Ar[0]
[out]: [1 3]
print Ar[1]
[out]: [2 4]
</pre>
If we want to access to the matrix by column:
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">print 'the first column: ', Ar[:,0]
[out]: the first column:  [1 2]
print 'the second column: ', Ar[:,1]
[out]: the second column:  [3 4]
</pre>
<h3>Array Functions</h3>
There are some very useful functions built in NumPy allow us to make calculations on an array or array elements.
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">print np.log(price_array)
[out]: [4.96793654  4.98244156  4.9675886   4.96995218  4.96633504  4.96018375]
</pre>
This function apply logarithm to each element and return an array.
Some functions return a single value:
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">print np.mean(price_array)
[out]: 143.896666667
print np.std(price_array)
[out]: 0.967379047852
print np.sum(price_array)
[out]: 863.38
print np.max(price_array)
[out]: 145.83
</pre>
The above functions return the mean, standard deviation(we will introduce these concepts in the following tutorials) and the max value of the array.
<h2>Pandas Basic</h2>
Pandas is probably the most powerful tools for dealing with financial data. Here we start from the basic Pandas data structure.
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">import pandas as pd
</pre>
<h3>Series</h3>
Series is a one-dimensional labeled array capable of holding any data type(integers, strings, float, python object, etc.) The axis labels are collectively refer to as the 'index'. The basic method to create a Series is to call Pandas.Series(data,index = index), where data can be a dictionary, an array or just a scalar value.
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">price = [143.73, 145.83, 143.68, 144.02, 143.5, 142.62]
s = pd.Series(price)
print s
0    143.73
1    145.83
2    143.68
3    144.02
4    143.50
5    142.62
</pre>
We can create our customized index while creating the series:
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">s = pd.Series(price,index = ['a','b','c','d','e','f'])
print s
a    143.73
b    145.83
c    143.68
d    144.02
e    143.50
f    142.62
</pre>
We can easily set or change the index of an existing arrar:
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">s.index = [6,5,4,3,2,1]
print s
6    143.73
5    145.83
4    143.68
3    144.02
2    143.50
1    142.62
</pre>
Series is like a list in that we can slice it by index:
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">print s[1:]
print s[:-2]
5    145.83
4    143.68
3    144.02
2    143.50
1    142.62
dtype: float64
6    143.73
5    145.83
4    143.68
3    144.02
dtype: float64
</pre>
Series is also like a fixed-size dictionary in that we can get and set values by index label:
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">print s[4]
s[4] = 0
print s
143.68
6    143.73
5    145.83
4      0.00
3    144.02
2    143.50
1    142.62
dtype: float64
</pre>
Series can also have a name attribute, which will be used when we make up a Pandas DataFrame using several series.
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">s = pd.Series(price, name = 'Apple Price List')
print s
print s.name
0    143.73
1    145.83
2    143.68
3    144.02
4    143.50
5    142.62
Name: Apple Price List, dtype: float64
Apple Price List
</pre>
<h3>Time Index</h3>
pandas has a built-in function specifically for creating date indices, Pandas.date_range(). We use the function here to create a new index for our series:
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">time_index = pd.date_range('2017-01-01',periods = len(s),freq = 'D')
print time_index
s.index = time_index
print s

DatetimeIndex(['2017-01-01', '2017-01-02', '2017-01-03', '2017-01-04',
               '2017-01-05', '2017-01-06'],
              dtype='datetime64[ns]', freq='D')
2017-01-01    143.73
2017-01-02    145.83
2017-01-03    143.68
2017-01-04    144.02
2017-01-05    143.50
2017-01-06    142.62
Freq: D, Name: Apple Price List, dtype: float64
</pre>
Series are usually accessed using the iloc[] and loc[] methods. iloc[] is used to access elements by integer index, and loc[] is used to access the index of the series.
iloc[] is necessary when the index of a series are integers, take our previous defined series as example:
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">s.index = [6,5,4,3,2,1]
print s
print s[1]
6    143.73
5    145.83
4    143.68
3    144.02
2    143.50
1    142.62
Name: Apple Price List, dtype: float64
142.62
</pre>
If we intended to take the second element of the series, we would make a mistake here, because the index are integers. In order to access to the element we want, we use iloc[] here:
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">print s.iloc[1]
145.83
</pre>
While working with time-series financial data, we often use time as index. Pandas provide us a variety of methods to access the data by time index.
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">s.index = time_index
print s['2017-01-03']
143.68
</pre>
We can even access to a range of dates:
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">print s['2017-01-02':'2017-01-05']
2017-01-02    145.83
2017-01-03    143.68
2017-01-04    144.02
2017-01-05    143.50
Freq: D, Name: Apple Price List, dtype: float64
</pre>
Series[] provides us a very flexible way to index data. We can add any condition in the square brackets:
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">print s[s &lt; np.mean(s)]
print s[(s &gt; np.mean(s)) &amp; (s &lt; np.mean(s) + 1.64*np.std(s))]

2017-01-01    143.73
2017-01-03    143.68
2017-01-05    143.50
2017-01-06    142.62
Name: Apple Price List, dtype: float64
2017-01-04    144.02
Freq: D, Name: Apple Price List, dtype: float64
</pre>
As demonstrated, we can use logical operators &amp;, |, and ~(and, or, and not, respectively) to group multiple conditions.
<h2>Summary</h2>
Here we introduced NumPy, and basic part of Pandas. Now we are able to do some scientific computing with Python. In the next chapter we will dive into Pandas to learn resampling and manipulating Pandas DataFrame, which is the most commonly used method to do financial data analysis.
