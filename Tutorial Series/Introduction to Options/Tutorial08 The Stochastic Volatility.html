We already knew that volatility is a measure of the fluctuation degree of the underlying assets price series. There are many types of volatilities. As we discussed in the last chapter, historical volatility is the standard deviation of the price series during a certain period. It is a constant and represents the price movement in the past. However, the implied volatility is not based on the historical pricing data of stocks. It is the value of volatility parameter derived from the market quote of options in BSM pricing model. In contrast to historical volatility, implied volatility is forward looking and varies with different options contracts.
