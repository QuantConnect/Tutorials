<h2>Introduction</h2>
In the last chapter, we discussed two of the volatilities: historical volatility and the implied volatility. This chapter, we will further extend the concept of volatility and introduce the local volatility and the stochastic volatility.
<h2>Motivation</h2>
We already knew that volatility is a measure of the fluctuation degree of the underlying assets price series. There are many types of volatilities. As we discussed in the last chapter, historical volatility is the standard deviation of the price series during a certain period. It is a constant and represents the price movement in the past. However, the implied volatility is not based on the historical pricing data of stocks. It is the value of volatility parameter derived from the market quote of options in BSM pricing model. In contrast to historical volatility, implied volatility is forward looking and varies with different options contracts.

In the Black–Scholes model, the asset’s price is modeled as a log-normal random variable, which means that the asset’s log-returns are normally distributed. One of the most significant assumptions in BSM model is that the volatility is a constant term over time.

\[\sigma=\sigma_{implied}(\text{constant})\]

But in the real world, it could be constant in a small time period but never constant in long term. As we discussed in the last chapter, there is volatility skew for most of the options, which means that the volatility is not constant across strikes.

[ref]Bouzoubaa M, Osseiran A. Exotic options and hybrids: A guide to structuring, pricing and trading[M]. John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2010.[/ref]One way to capture the volatility skew is to assume that that the volatility itself is a random variable, this is the stochastic volatility model we will discuss next. But on the other hand, the introduction of additional sources of randomness will increase the complexity of the model. The other way to capture the volatility skew but without introducing the additional source of randomness is the local volatility.
<h2>Local Volatility</h2>
The constant volatility assumption in BSM model seems not reasonable in most of the options pricing. The volatility skew tells us that the stock’s log-returns are actually not normally distributed. That means there exist some other kinds of distributions of stock price so that if we use this distribution to price the options, it would give the accurate options' price as we see in the market. The local volatility is implied in this non-normal distribution. Let's look at the definition of local volatility.

The local volatility of the underlying assets is a deterministic function of assets price and the time t.

\[\sigma=\sigma(S_t,t)\]

Thus local volatility model calculates volatilities for the different combination of strike prices and expires. For a given date, time(t) and the underlying stock prices(St), a local volatility is derived from the equation that options prices calculated using local volatility equal the market options prices. Finding the function \(\sigma(S_t,t)\) is known as the calibration.
<h2>Stochastic Volatility</h2>
<h3>1. Definition</h3>

<div class="page" title="Page 328">In stochastic volatility models, the asset price and its volatility are both assumed to be random processes and can change over time. There are many stochastic volatility models. Here we will present the most well-known and popular one: the Heston Model. In Heston model, the stock prices are lognormal distributed, the volatility process is a positive increasing function of a mean-reversion process. That is[ref]Gatheral J. The volatility surface: a practitioner's guide[M]. John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2011[/ref]</div>

\[dS_t = \mu_tS_tdt＋\sqrt{v_t}S_tdW_{1,t}\]

\[dv_t=-\lambda(v_t-\overline{v})\ dt+\sigma\sqrt{v_t}\ dW_{2,t}\]

\[&lt;dW_{1,t},\ dW_{2,t}&gt;=\rho \ dt\]

Where the volatility \(v_t\) itself is a stochastic process. \(\lambda\) is the speed of reversion of \(v_t\) to its long-term mean \(\overline{v})\). \(\sigma)\ is the volatility of the variance process\(v_t\) (often called the volatility of volatility). (W_{1,t}\) and \(W_{2,t}\) are two dependent Wiener processes with correlation coefficient \(\rho\).
<h3>2. Simulation of the Heston process</h3>
We already discuss how to simulate the stock price process with Monte Carlo method in the introduction to stochastic process tutorial. In order to simulate the variance process, we need to write it into discrete form. The derivation can be found in paper Rouah F D. <a href="http://www.frouah.com/finance%20notes/Euler%20and%20Milstein%20Discretization.pdf">Euler and Milstein discretization</a>[ref]Rouah F D. Euler and Milstein discretization[J]. Documento de Trabajo, Sapient Global Markets, Estados Unidos, 2011.[/ref].

\[v_{t+\Delta t}=\left(\sqrt{v_t}+\frac{1}{2}\sigma\sqrt{\Delta t}W_1\right)^2-\lambda(v_t-\overline{v})\Delta t-\frac{\sigma^2}{4}\Delta t\]

Then, we take the following steps to simulate Heston process:
<ol>
 	<li>Given the value of \(v_t\) at time t, we first update to \(v_{t+\Delta t}\) using the formula above</li>
 	<li>We obtain \(S_{t+\Delta t}\) using\[S_{t+\Delta t}=S_t\ \text {exp}\left[(r-\frac{1}{2}v_t)\Delta t+\sqrt{v_t\Delta t}W_2\right]\]</li>
 	<li>To generate \(W_1\) and \(W_2\) with correlation \(\rho\), we first generate two independent standard normal variables \(Z_1\) and \(Z_2\), set \(W_1=Z_1\), then \(\rho Z_1+\sqrt{1-\rho^2}Z_2\).</li>
</ol>
In allowing the volatility to be random, stochastic volatility models give rise to implied volatility skews and term structures.
