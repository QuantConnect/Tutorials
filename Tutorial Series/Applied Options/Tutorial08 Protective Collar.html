<h2>Definition</h2>
Protective Collar is an option strategy that involves both the underlying stock and two option contracts. The trader buys (or already owns) a stock, then buys an out-the-money put option and sells an out-the-money call option.  It is similar to the covered call strategy with the purchase of an additional put option. It is being used if the trader is writing covered calls but wish to protect himself from an unexpected downside sharp move in the price of the underlying security. As a tradeoff, the profit will become limited compared with the covered call strategy.
<h2>Payoff</h2>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums"># Protective Collar
price = np.arange(700,950,1)
# assume at time 0, the price of the undelying stock is 830
k_otm_put = 800 # the strike price of OTM put
k_otm_call = 860 # the strike price of OTM call
premium_otm_put = 6 # the premium of OTM put

According to the payoff plot, the maximum profit is the strike price of short call minus the purchase price of the underlying asset add the net credit from the premium. It occurs when the stock price is beyond the strike price of the short call option. The maximum loss is the purchase price of the underlying asset minus the strike price of the long put minus the net credit from the premium. It occurs when the stock price is below the strike price of the long put. It is a strategy with limit risk and limit profit.
<h2>Implementation</h2>
Step 1: Initialize your algorithm that involves setting the start date and the end date, setting the cash and implement the coarse selection of option contracts.
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">def Initialize(self):
	self.SetStartDate(2016, 1, 01)
	self.SetEndDate(2016, 3, 01)
	self.SetCash(1000000)
	equity = self.AddEquity("GOOG", Resolution.Minute)
	option = self.AddOption("GOOG", Resolution.Minute)
	self.symbol = option.Symbol
	# set our strike/expiry filter for this option chain
	option.SetFilter(-10, +10, timedelta(0), timedelta(30))
	# use the underlying equity as the benchmark
	self.SetBenchmark(equity.Symbol)
</pre>
Step 2: Choose the expiration date for your options traded and break the options into the call and put contracts. The choice of expiration date depends on the holding period of stocks in your portfolio.
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">def TradeOptions(self,optionchain):
    for i in optionchain:
	if i.Key != self.symbol: continue
	chain = i.Value
	# choose the furthest expiration date within 30 days from now on
	expiry = sorted(chain, key = lambda x: x.Expiry)[-1]
	# filter the call options contracts
	call = [x for x in chain if x.Right == 0 and x.Expiry == expiry]
	# filter the put options contracts
	put = [x for x in chain if x.Right == 1 and x.Expiry == expiry]
</pre>
Step 3: Choose the deep in-the-money call and put options in the list and then sell the call options and buy the put options.
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">self.otm_call = sorted(call, key = lambda x: x.Strike)[-1]
self.otm_put = sorted(put, key = lambda x: x.Strike)[0]
if (self.otm_call is None) or (self.otm_put is None): continue
self.Sell(self.otm_call.Symbol, 1) # sell the OTM call
self.Buy(self.otm_put.Symbol, 1) # buy the OTM put
</pre>
Step 4: In Ondata, if there is no assets in portfolio, we buy the undelying stocks. After that, we trade the options which equivalent to the amount of your stocks holding. (one option contracts equals 100 undelying shares).
<pre>def OnData(self,slice):
    optionchain = slice.OptionChains
    for i in slice.OptionChains:
    if i.Key != self.symbol: continue
    chains = i.Value
    contract_list = [x for x in chains]
    if (slice.OptionChains.Count == 0) or (len(contract_list) == 0): return
    # if you don't hold options and stocks, buy the stocks and trade the options
    if not self.Portfolio.Invested:
	self.Buy("GOOG",100)	 # buy 100 shares of the underlying stock
	self.TradeOptions(optionchain)   # sell OTM call and buy OTM put
</pre>
<h2>Summary</h2>
In this algorithm, at the beginning  01/04/2016, we purchased 100 GOOG shares. At the same time, we purchased a $715 put at $6 and sells a $772.5 call at $2.45. The share price of GOOG is $739.32, which is between the strike prices of two out-the-money options. At the expiry 01/15/2016, the share price of GOOG drops to $714.32. The call option expire worthless but the put option is exercised. Then we sell 100 GOOG shares at $715. Then we hold neither option positions and stock positions.
