The goal of this series is to introduce the common options strategies to those who already have basic knowledge of
    options markets and most importantly, we will teach users how to start your simple options trading algorithm on
    QuantConnect. These strategies will demonstrate a few of the ways in which options can be used to produce an
    interesting relationship between profit and stock price. We will primarily talk about the strategies like the
    Covered Call which involves a single option and the undelying stock, the spreads which involve either taking a
    position in two or more calls or puts, the conbinations like straddle or strangle which involve taking a position in
    both calls and puts on the same stocks. For each strategy, except for the description of strategy itself, we will
    demonstrate the QuantConnect algorithm implemented in Python.
